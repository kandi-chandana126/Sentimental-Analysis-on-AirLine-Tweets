Airline Tweets Sentiment Analysis using DistilBERT
 Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a key Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that determines the emotional tone behind a piece of text.
This project focuses on analyzing airline-related tweets and classifying them into three sentiment categories:

Positive → Indicates customer satisfaction or praise

Negative → Reflects dissatisfaction, complaints, or criticism

Neutral → Represents factual or emotionless statements

The aim is to help airlines, travel agencies, and analysts understand customer perception and service quality trends.
